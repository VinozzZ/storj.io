            <p>Storj has developed the open source Software (defined below) to create and monetize an exabyte-scale distributed and decentralized cloud storage network.  In order for this project to succeed, participants of all peer classes defined in the <a href="/whitepaper/">Company White Paper</a> must operate within a clearly established framework of rules.  This document establishes the terms and conditions for such storage node operators.</p>
            <p>In particular, the Agreement below provides the terms pursuant to which storage node operators may use the Software to share space with Storj and realize an economic benefit from doing so.  The Software may be used to share space with others besides Storj subject to the open source license, but any such use is outside the scope of this Agreement, and Storj has no obligations or responsibilities in connection with any such use.</p>
